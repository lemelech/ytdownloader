# ytdownloader

### motive
I download lot's of music from youtube,
I'm sick of online youtube-to-mp3 online converters, so decided to write my own python script to do so.  

### usage
python ytdownloader.py
- copy youtube links to clipboard (ctrl+c -or- ctrl+insert)

### function
downloads mp4-stream audio and converts to mp3

### additional requirements
uses (requires) ffmpeg to convert to mp3
