I'm sick of online youtube-to-mp3 online converters, so decided to write my own python script to do so.

  -or python -m ytdownloader
  -or yt2mp3

then:
- copy youtube links to clipboard (ctrl+c -or- ctrl+insert)

### Function
downloads mp4-stream audio and converts to mp3

### Additional requirements
Uses (requires) ffmpeg to convert to mp3.
